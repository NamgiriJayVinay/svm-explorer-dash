### Info
**Polynomial Regression:** In this technique, a curve fits into the data points. In a polynomial regression equation, the power of the independent variable is greater than 1. Although higher degree polynomials give lower error, they might also result in over-fitting.

**Regularization:** is a technique used to solve the overfitting problem in statistical models. In machine learning, regularization penalizes the coefficients such that the model generalize better. We have different types of regression techniques which uses regularization such as Ridge regression and lasso regression.

**Ridge Regression:** Ridge regression performs **L2 regularization**, i.e. it adds a factor of sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the
